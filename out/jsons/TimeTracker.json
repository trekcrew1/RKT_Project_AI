  "overview": {
    "summary": "Build a modern, compliant time and attendance system that replaces spreadsheets and manual forms with an employee portal, manager dashboard, automated overtime and Paid Time Off (PTO) accruals, and exportable reports for Human Resources (HR) and payroll. Architect for multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) to monetize externally, while piloting internally first for speed and fidelity.",
    "problem_statement": "Manual time tracking via spreadsheets, email, and forms causes inaccuracies, approval delays, poor visibility, and compliance risk (e.g., overtime miscalculation, missing attestations). HR and payroll teams spend excessive time cleaning data and reconciling errors, risking wage-and-hour noncompliance.",
    "goals": [
      "Reduce timesheet processing time by 60% vs. current baseline within 3 months of internal launch",
      "Achieve <1% payroll export error rate during internal pilot",
      "Provide compliant overtime and PTO accrual calculations configurable per policy",
      "Enable manager same-day approvals with real-time schedule and exception visibility",
      "Launch external paid beta within 16–18 weeks with seat-based billing",
      "Reach $10k ARR within 6 months of external beta through SMB customers"
    ],
    "non_goals": [
      "Full payroll processing (we export to payroll; we do not run payroll)",
      "Complex workforce scheduling/forecasting (beyond basic shift visibility)",
      "Union contract adjudication engines",
      "Biometric hardware time clocks",
      "Global labor law automation beyond configurable rules and basic presets"
    ],
    "background": "Per the Aug 19, 2025 internal brief, the company needs an internal time tracking system with employee clock in/out, PTO requests, manager approvals, automated overtime/accruals, and HR/payroll exports, hosted on company infrastructure and integrated with existing workflows. To create a revenue-generating product, we will build the core to solve internal needs first (single tenant) while designing a secure multi-tenant architecture. After internal validation, we will commercialize as a SaaS offering for small and medium businesses (SMBs), integrating common payroll systems and adding subscription billing."
